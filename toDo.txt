- deleteReservation endpoint -> Check if user has that reservation and put it to "user" controller.

- Add more data (movie, seats, room) to the getUserReservations.
- Add picture saving for movies.
- Add database violation exception handling.
- Maybe money payback.

- Bad statuscode at SeatAlreadyReservedException in Reservation. (?)
